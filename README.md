# IOA

This is a collaborative project in support of surgical education - in particular the technical and non-technical evaluation of trainees' performance in the Operating Room (OR).


Contents:

/Forms

 - Includes a link to the Modified Ottawa Surgical Competency Evaluation form (via Microsoft Forms). This will permit collaborators to duplicate the current version of the Emory form for use at their training program.

/Flow

 - Includes export of Flow (Microsoft Power Automate) that handles transfer of Forms data (triggered on form submission) to a custom SharePoint list with implementation of access restrictions on the resulting record (full access to program administration group, read only access to the resident and corresponding faculty advisor).
